# Candelabrum ![Candelabrum Icon](image/candelabrum.png)
[Kindlegen](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211) is main tool that eBook developers have for translating ePub into Mobi files, but as a command-line tool, it can be unfriendly to new users.

As a Mac user, I was fortunate to discover Candelabrum a couple of years ago, which is a professional GUI wrapper for Kindlegen.  In the Candelabrum preferences, you configure the path to your Kindlegen executable, and then you can simply drag ePubs onto Candelabrum in your dock.  Awesome!

Unfortunately, I can no longer find Candelabrum available at [candelabrum.net](http://candelabrum.net), and while there is a [Google+ profile](https://plus.google.com/114565990555225238165/posts), there's no activity since 2011.

In the interests of preserving this fantastic piece of software, which I have determinedly copied between various computers I've used over the years, I'm placing it in this repo so that other eBook developers can use it if they like.

*Note: If the developer of candelabrum has any issue with me doing this, please don't hesitate to contact me.*
